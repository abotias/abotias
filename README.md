Hello!

My name is Adrián Botías. 
I am an information systems enthusiast. I work as a systems administrator, and I am currently developing my knowledge in cybersecurity. 

I am using github as a personal knowledge base.
With this I want to improve my documentation, scripts, deployments, automations and learn git.
I share my knowledge and adaptations in case they can be of help to someone, like I have consulted documentation of colleagues in the network.

You can contact through the different platforms referenced in the profile.


Welcome!
